0.4.5
-- Updated show_running() function to be compatible with PostgreSQL 9.2
-- Updated Makefile to allow setting of grep binary if needed during building.
-- Created CHANGELOG file.


0.4.4
-- Update monitor function to handle procpid column name change to pid in pg_stat_activity


0.4.3
-- Added port column to dblink_mapping table to allow changing the default port.


0.4.2
-- No code changes to extension itself. Restructured sql file organization and modified Makefile to handle it accordingly.
-- Did make the cancel_job test a little clearer on what to do in the testjob function.


0.4.1
-- Created job_log_clear() function to clear log data previous to a given interval. Logs it too!
-- Fixed job_detail table to have ON DELETE CASCADE foreign key to make this function easier to write


0.4.0
-- Adds sql_job() and sql_step() functions for simple query logging.


0.3.5
-- Fixed check_job_status to use the end_time instead of the start_time in job_log to determine the last run of a job. Also more clearly lets you know if a job is blocked by an object lock


0.3.4
-- Make column names in job_status_text table more consistent with the check_job_status() function return column names.
-- Fix check_job_status() returning extra spaces and ; in the alert_text when a job has failed
-- Fix check_job_status() to use alert_text value for code 3 instead of hardcoded value 'CRITICAL'


0.3.3
-- See update sql file for important instructions.
-- Turn off the dump of table data for the log tables. pg_dump isn't handling this properly and will dump all the data out for these tables even in a --schema-only dump.
-- Data for other tables is minimal, and more critical, so not removing their dump settings.
-- Data for these tables can be dumped if it's needed by temporarily removing the table from the extention and then adding it back.


0.3.2
-- Fixed bug in check_job_status result when all jobs were ok


0.3.0
IMPORTANT NOTE: Version 0.3.0 introduced backward incompatibilities and a direct upgrade is not possible. Please backup data tables and reinstall extension. 
All constraints were given specific names so future updates can more easily be done using the extension system. 
update_step() parameters have changed.
close, fail and cancel functions can no longer take a custom config table. Was a nice idea but doesn't work as I'd hoped.
job_alert_nagios table changed to job_status_text.
job_detail elapsed_time column data type changed.
